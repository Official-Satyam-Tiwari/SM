Use Python numerical simulations for solving the problems based on Statistical Mechanics.

1. Computational analysis of the behavior of a collection of particles in a box that satisfy
Newtonian mechanics and interact via the Lennard-Jones potential, varying the total
number of particles N and the initial conditions:
a) Study of local number density in the equilibrium state (i) average; (ii) fluctuations
b) Study of transient behavior of the system (approach to equilibrium)
c) Relationship of large N and the arrow of time
d) Computation of the velocity distribution of particles for the system and comparison with
the Maxwell velocity distribution.

2. Plot the probability of various macrostates in coin-tossing experiment (two level system)
versus number of heads with 4, 8, 16 coins etc.

3. Computation of the partition function Z(b) for the systems with a finite number of single
particle levels (e.g., 2 level, 3 level etc.) and finite number of non-interacting particles
N under Maxwell-Boltzmann/ Fermi-Dirac/Bose Einstein statistics:
a) Study the behavior of Z(b), average energy, Cv, and entropy and its dependence upon the
temperature, total number of particles N and the spectrum of single particle energy
states.
b) Plot the probability of occupancy of all the states w.r.t. temperature.

4. Plot the Maxwell speed distribution function at different temperatures in a 3-dimension
system. Calculate the average speed, root mean square and most probable speed.

5. Plot Specific Heat of Solids w.r.t temperature
a) Dulong-Petit law,
b) Einstein distribution function
c) Debye distribution function

6. Plot the following functions with energy at different temperatures
a) Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
b) Fermi-Dirac distribution
c) Bose-Einstein distribution

7. Plot the distribution of particles w.r.t. energy (dN/de versus e) in 3 Dimensions for
a) Relativistic and non-relativistic bosons both at high and low temperature.
b) Relativistic and non-relativistic fermions both at high and low temperature.

8. Plot Planck’s law of Black body radiation w.r.t. wavelength/frequency at different
temperatures. Compare it with Rayleigh-Jeans Law and Wien’s distribution law for a
given temperature.
